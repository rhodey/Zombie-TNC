Zombie-TNC
=======
  
Just when you thought the TNC was dead and buried.  
  
Working towards a highly programmable, full featured AX.25 terminal
node controller. Currently Zombie-TNC relies on another TNC running in
KISS mode to provice HDLC framing, radio modulation and radio
demodulation. Eventually these dependencies will hopefully be removed
and Zombie-TNC will be a standalone, platform-independant TNC.  
  
This project was started out of the need for some custom satellite
ground control software, bits and pieces of such software will likely
stick around this repo until it is trivial to seperate the two.
